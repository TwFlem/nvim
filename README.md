# Nvim Setup

## Fonts

This section describes installing fonts for a new machine and how to add new fonts as desired

### Adding new fonts

This setup leverages [NerdFonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/v2.3.3#single-font). Follow the directions for installing whatever you want. Probably easiest just to shallow clone the repo and use the install script ;)
